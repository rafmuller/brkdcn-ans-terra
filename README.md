# Example repository for Cisco Live breakout session BRKDCN-2606 and BRKDCN-2607

This repository contains the code examples used in the Cisco Live breakout session BRKDCN-2606 and BRKDCN-2607. There are two directories, one for Ansible and one for Terraform. This example repository will allow you to follow some of the material covered in the presentation. Providing a foundation for you to build upon and automate your own data center network.
